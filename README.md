## Featured tools

This project provides a couple of standalone starter samples in the [quickstarts](/quickstarts/) directory. Each can be run locally to demonstrate how to use one or more of these JS tools.

- Webpack - to bundle to a single JS file
- Browserify - to bundle to a single JS file
- Babel - to transpile from modern JS to older JS for compatibility and also handles JSX to JS.
- TypeScript - to transpile from TS to JS

Some sections include an `index.html` to test the JS in the browser.

Most of this project is based on this article - [Understanding JavaScript Modules: Bundling & Transpiling](https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-modules-bundling-transpiling/) (Sitepoint post, 2016). There are other tools covered there which are similar to the ones above. The article says that this area is _complicated_.

If you are looking for a way to do all the bundling and transpiling tasks above and more without installing separate node packages, then consider switching from Node.js to [Deno](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/dev-cheatsheets/tree/master/cheatsheets/javascript/deno/). It does all that and more.

### Choosing a tool

The most popular tools in the community seem to be Webpack, Babel and TypeScript, so you'll probably be fine setting those up in your project.

There are an overwhelming number of alternatives and additional loaders like for CSS. These are covered in [Resources](#resources) section.

### Bundling without Node or 3rd party packages

If you are struggling to decide between, configure and learn a bundling and transpilation tool, you may be interested in an alternative to Node called Deno.

It can handle running TypeScript and [JSX](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/3038) and it can bundle to a single JS file. All without any external dependencies to install or configure.

```sh
$ deno run index.ts
$ demo bundle index.ts build/bundle.js
```

See my [Deno Project Template](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/deno-project-template) for more info.


## Requirements

- Node.js
- `make` - standard on macOS and Linux. On Windows you'll have to run the Makefile commands directly. Or skip them. You will see instructions ton use `node` and `npm`.

## Installation

### System dependencies

Install Node.js - follow [gist instructions](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/aa1fc56419a355972b96bce23f3bccba)

### Clone the repo.

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:MichaelCurrin/javascript-bundling-quickstarts.git
$ cd javascript-bundling-quickstarts
```

### Install project dependencies

Run this command to install dependencies for _all_ quickstarts. Or skip to the next section to install dependencies for one quickstart at a time.

```sh
$ make install
```


## Usage

Explore the examples in the [quickstarts](/quickstarts/) directory.

To install and run an app, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to a target app. e.g.
    ```sh
    $ cd quickstarts/babel
    ```
2. Install packages.
    ```sh
    $ npm i
    ```
3. Build the app.
    ```sh
    $ npm run build
    ```
4. Test in the browser if relevant, or run the script use `node`.


## Why use these tools?

### Why bundle scripts?

We use a bundler to take modules with dependencies and generate static assets representing those modules.

Features:

- Allows imports with `require('modules')` - whether your own module like `lib.js` or an external NPM package like `lodash`.
- No globals required.
- Source order independence.
- No need for namespacing your own application code.

See [browserify](/quickstarts/browserify/) and [webpack](/quickstarts/webpack/) directories in this project. These compile using CommonJS modules. The output will be the same but with different styles for logging and output.

### Why transpile scripts?

Some server-side scripts are needed to prepare the scripts, such as Babel to transpile React code or just modern JS to older JS for compatibility. TypeScript also needs transpiling.

See the [babel](/quickstarts/babel/) and [typescript](/quickstarts/typescript) directories.
